NYC Foreclosures

Despite a strong housing market nationwide, there have been two consecutive month-over-month increases in foreclosure rates. (Granted, foreclosure rates are still near all-time lows.) In NYC specifically, the rate of foreclosures has more than doubled in the last five years, according to PropertyShark Data.

I want to explore foreclosure rates in the five boroughs, and see if
I'd like to use Property Shark data to explore the boroughs/neighborhoods with the most foreclosures, and see if they are more common among apartment buildings or commercial.

I can talk to a local business owner, or someone who is going through the foreclosure process. I could also try speaking to a local realtor or housing analyst.

This could be pitched to local news outlets, or to a real estate publication.

UPDATE Property Shark Data did not transfer well. Instead found data from the NYU Furman Center.

Steps: downloaded Furman data and put into excel
